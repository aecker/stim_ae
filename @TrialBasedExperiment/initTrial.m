function e = initTrial(e)
% Initialize trial.
%    This function can be used to initialize the following trial, i.e. perform
%    time-consuming operations which we don't want to do during showStimulus.
%
%    When overwriting this function in derived experiment types, make sure that
%    the parent function (i.e. this one) is also called:
%        derivedExp = initTrial(derivedExp.TrialBasedExperiment)

% AE 2007-10-05

% nothing to do, yet...
