Notes on white noise orientation discrimination stimulus

- Do we want to change signalProb to signalFraction meaning that the 
    fraction of signal frames is always deterministic?

- Need to implement fraction of fixed seed trials

- Need to implement fraction of zero signal trials (also with fixed seed, 
    at least some?)

- Phase is not randomized at the moment (if we want to randomize it, then
    probably only across trials but keep it fixed within ne trial to avoid 
    apparent motion)

- levels go through logit function instead of 2^level. This might need some
    adjustments as to where the linear part of the function is. This might
    also have to be changed completely
